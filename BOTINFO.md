# jColour

In a sentence, jColour is a bot that creates a website for managing colour roles on your Discord server.

## Features
* Display available colours on a sleek web interface
* Pick a colour from a list of existing colours
* Get a random colour from the list of existing colours
* Get the colour that suits your avatar the best from existing colours
* Create user-specific hex colour roles (hex code, random, most suitable)
* Give a colour to new members by default
* Restrict access to colours or hex colours to the members of a role

## How do I use it?
I recommend taking a look at our [documentation](https://jcolour.jaqreven.com/docs), but here are the most important parts in a nutshell:
1. Remove colours from existing roles
2. Invite me to your server
3. Create roles that are named "colour [name]" (ex. "colour red" without the quotation marks) and give that role a colour
4. That should be it! Try running j-colour or visiting [the website](https://jcolour.jaqreven.com).

Again, if you wish to use the more advanced features, please refer to the [documentation](https://jcolour.jaqreven.com/docs).

## Demo
Hey, we get it - you might want to try the bot before inviting it to your server.

## Data Collection
I, like many others, believe that privacy is a human right.  
Therefore we try to collect as little data as possible. Here's everything we collect about you:
* Anonymous executed commands (just the command itself, no arguments)
* Page loads at https://jcolour.jaqreven.com (logs)
* Chosen prefixes for servers
* Dark mode preference on the website

To have all your data reset, simply switch to the light mode on the website and reset the prefix to its default (@jColour prefix default).
