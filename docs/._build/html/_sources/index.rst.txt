Help
-----

To see all my commands, please refer to j-help.

Prefix
-------

You can change my prefix with j-prefix:

* j-prefix default (to get back to the default prefix)
* j-prefix none (no prefixes, you can still @tag me, ex. @jColour colour red)
* j-prefix ! (uses ! as a prefix, ex. !colour red)

If you've forgotten my prefix, you can always tag me instead: @jColour prefix default

Default colour
---------------

You can also restrict hex colours to a specific role: :ref:`hex`
